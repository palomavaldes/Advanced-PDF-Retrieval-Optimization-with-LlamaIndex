Advanced PDF Retrieval &amp; Optimization with LlamaIndex for Mortgage Documents

In the mortgage industry, the workflow of processing mortgage documentations is tedious, and small details can go unnoticed because of the messy and verbose nature of these legal documents. This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline allows for users to ask document specific questions without shifting through long documents. 

This prototype acts like a chatbot, where the user can ask questions such as:
"What is the total estimated monthly payment?"
"How much does the borrower pay for lender's title insurance?"

Tech Stack: LlamaIndex, PyMuPDF, and HuggingFace embeddings to build the pipeline.
Key Concepts Learned: Implementation of embedding models, chunking strategies, retrieval methods
